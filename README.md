## How to run this solution
this solution is written in python. In this repo/zip file, you can view the output, which is written to output.json by the python script. Alternatively, you can run it locally by navigating to main.py and executing it, or head to (replit.com) to run it in a browser-based IDE.

## My thought process / solution design
when I first read over the challenge, my only thought was "whoa, this is going to be a lot of for loops." After that, however, I went and got a grasp of the app by drawing out how things interact with each other, and then started planning out what files and classes I would need via a kinda-sorta UML-diagram ish drawing.

## Primary technical problems
this challenge was kind of a combination of what we've done over the semester in PD1 (program and design implementation 1). Because of this, I didn't really have an issue writing the actual code. For me, the harder part was coming up with an architecture to build this solution using the best design principles. While my program design definitely is not the best, I'm still pretty proud of the architecture I came up with and the way all the classes and files interact with each other. A key weakness however, is how reliant the methods in stats.py are on each other. If I had more time, this is definitely something I would work to improve. 

## Approx time for completion
took roughly 7 hours
